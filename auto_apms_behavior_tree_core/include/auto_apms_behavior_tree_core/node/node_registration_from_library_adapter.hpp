/**
 * @brief A node registration interface that is able to load and registers behavior tree nodes from a shared library
 * using `BT::BehaviorTreeFactory::registerFromPlugin`.
 *
 * The libraries must export the `BT_RegisterNodesFromPlugin(factory)` symbol which is the ROS-agnostic approach for
 * distributing behavior tree nodes through plugins in BehaviorTree.CPP.
 *
 * You can find an example of how to implement the required plugin export macro in the official BehaviorTree.CPP
 * repository:
 * https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/blob/3ff6a32ba0497a08519c77a1436e3b81eff1bcd6/examples/plugin_example/plugin_action.cpp
 *
 * **Usage:**
 *
 * 1. Create a subclass of this adapter for each plugin library you want to load nodes from. Implement the
 *    NodeRegistrationFromLibraryAdapter::getPluginLibraryPath() method to return the respective library path.
 *
 * 2. Apply the pluginlib practices to register adapter subclasses as a node registration plugin using the
 *    PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS macro.
 *
 *    ```cpp
 *    #include "pluginlib/class_list_macros.hpp"
 *    #include "auto_apms_behavior_tree_core/node/node_registration_interface.hpp"
 *
 *    PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS(
 *      my_namespace::MyNodeRegistrationType,
 *      auto_apms_behavior_tree::core::NodeRegistrationInterface)
 *    ```
 *
 *    You also need to create a plugin manifest XML file and list the adapter subclasses as plugins in the manifest.
 *    Follow ROS 2's documentation for details on how to do this:
 *    https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Pluginlib.html
 *
 * 3. Use the NODE_REGISTRATION_TYPE keyword in the `auto_apms_behavior_tree_register_nodes` macro in your
 *    CMakeLists.txt to specify the adapter subclass as the registration type for the nodes you want to register from
 *    the plugin library.
 *
 *    ```cmake
 *    auto_apms_behavior_tree_register_nodes(my_nodes
 *      my_package::MyNodeRegistrationType
 *      NODE_REGISTRATION_TYPE my_package::MyNodeRegistrationType
 *    )
 *    ```
 *
 *    In this case, you need to specify `my_package::MyNodeRegistrationType` both under ARGN and NODE_REGISTRATION_TYPE.
 *    Supplying multiple args under ARGN would create ambiguity, because there would be multiple names for the same
 *    collection of nodes. The convention is to call this macro once for each node registration type (if it's not a
 *    template).
 *
 * 4. In your node manifest YAML, specify the fully qualified name of the adapter subclass as the class name for the
 *    nodes you want to register from the plugin library. You can specify the same adapter subclass multiple times with
 *    different registration names to register multiple nodes from the same library.
 *
 *    ```yaml
 *    MyNodeName:
 *      class_name: my_package::MyNodeRegistrationType
 *
 *    MyOtherNodeName:
 *      class_name: my_package::MyNodeRegistrationType
 *    ```
 *
 *    As you see, it is also possible to register multiple nodes from the same plugin library using the same adapter
 *    subclass.
