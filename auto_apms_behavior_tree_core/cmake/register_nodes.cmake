# Add behavior tree node plugins to the package's resources.
#
# This macro must be called to make behavior tree node plugins available
# at runtime and configure their registration with the behavior tree
# factory. Optionally, a corresponding node model header is generated.
# This header facilitates integrating the specified nodes when building
# behavior trees using the TreeDocument API.
#
# :param target: Shared library target implementing the behavior tree
#   nodes registered under ARGN.
# :type target: string
# :param ARGN: The unique names of node classes being registered with this
#   macro call and exported by the shared library target.
# :type ARGN: list of strings
# :param NODE_MANIFEST: One or more relative paths or existing resource identities of node manifests.
#   Multiple file paths are concatenated to a single one.
# :type NODE_MANIFEST: list of strings
# :param NODE_MODEL_HEADER_TARGET: Name of a shared library target. If specified,
#   generate a C++ header that defines model classes for all behavior tree
#   nodes specified inside the node manifest files provided under NODE_MANIFEST and
#   add it to the includes of the given target.

    # IMPORTANT: Disable LTO (Link-Time Optimization) for behavior tree node plugin libraries.
    #
    # Problem: When building on platforms that enable LTO by default (e.g., ROS 2 build farms
    # where dpkg-buildflags includes -flto=auto), the create_node_model CLI tool
    # crashes with a segfault during BT::writeTreeNodesModelXML(). This segfault is caught during
    # build time as we call the create_node_model executable as a custom command for generating
    # the node models for the standard behavior tree nodes that auto_apms_behavior_tree
    # comes with. It would also occur at runtime when loading any LTO-compiled plugin libraries
    # registered using this macro.
    #
    # Root cause: LTO optimization occurs within each shared library's compilation unit in isolation.
    # This plugin library instantiates BehaviorTree.CPP templates (e.g., registerNodeType<T>) that
    # manipulate internal data structures of the BT::BehaviorTreeFactory. When the LTO-compiled
    # plugin is loaded at runtime via dlopen() by a CLI tool linked against behaviortree_cpp
    # (which was compiled as a separate shared library), the optimized code makes assumptions
    # about memory layout and function signatures that may not hold across the shared library
    # boundary. Even if both libraries are built with LTO, the optimization cannot cross the
    # dlopen() boundary, leading to ABI incompatibilities and crashes.
    #
    # Solution: Disable LTO for these plugin libraries to ensure the template instantiations
    # produce standard ABI-compliant code that works correctly when loaded by any tool linked
    # against behaviortree_cpp, regardless of how that library was compiled.
